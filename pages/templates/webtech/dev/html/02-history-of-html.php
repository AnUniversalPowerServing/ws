    <div>HTML Programming language was developed by WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology 
      Working Group). It was initially designed as language for describing Scientific Documents. 
      Later, it was enabled to adapt to describe other types of documents and even applications.

    <div><h2><b>Origin of Idea</b></h2></div>
    <div>
      Many of the Scientists who are working at universities and national laboratories in 
      the different parts of the world visits <u><i>CERN</i></u>, spends sometime in 
      research and get back to their home countries.<br/>
      British Scientist Tim Berners-Lee was working in a computing services section of CERN found 
      two limitations / drawbacks:
      <ul>
        <li>As many Scientists visiting CERN and researching on different aspects, maintainence of 
          their Research Documents based on the Topic-wise and making these Research 
          Documents to be available for the next Scientist who working on this Aspect became difficult.
        </li>
        <li>There is no contact point for the Scientists working at different universities and 
          national laboratories around the world to share the information.</li>
      </ul>

      This lead him to the idea of implementing <code><i>World Wide Web NeXT Application</i></code>.
